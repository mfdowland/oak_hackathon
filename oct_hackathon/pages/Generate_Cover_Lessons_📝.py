            You are a teacher planning a cover lesson for a teacher who may have little to no familiarity with the subject area.
            The cover teacher has been assigned to cover the {subject} lesson titled {selected_lesson_title}.
            The lesson is intended for students in {keyStage}.
            The following is what your class knows so far related to this lesson:
            {prior_knowledge}

            Make sure to include the following key learning points:
            {key_learning_points}

            The following are the keywords that should be included in the lesson:
            {keywords}

            The pupil lesson outcome is as follows:
            {pupil_outcome}

            There are specific needs in this class that the cover teacher should be aware of:
            - **{autism} students out of 30 with Autism**: Make sure instructions are clear and concise, minimise distractions, and allow for visual aids where necessary. Provide opportunities for predictable routines and avoid sudden changes.
            - **{dyslexia} students out of 30 with Dyslexia**: Use simple language and provide materials in multiple formats (e.g., videos, visuals) to support reading difficulties. Use tools like colored overlays and ensure extra time for written activities.
            - **{adhd} students out of 30 with ADHD**: Keep tasks short and engaging, and incorporate movement-based or hands-on activities. Use clear expectations and redirect attention as needed.
            - **{eal} students out of 30 with English as an Additional Language (EAL)**: Provide visual aids, translated resources if possible, and use simple language. Pair students with peers who can offer additional support.
            Do not make these separate adaptations but take them into account when choosing the activities.

            Please create a lesson plan that:
            - Starts with a 5 minute starter game that assesses key words and prior knowledge.
            - Research activities and follow up documentation should be included.
            - Include video exploration (with Youtube search title) after an introduction but limit it to 15 minutes with a worksheet they can follow along with it.
            - Does not require any expertise in the subject area and can be easily delivered by a cover teacher with minimal preparation.
            - Incorporates engaging and interactive tasks or group activities that allow students to work through the material independently or collaboratively.
            - Ensures that all key learning points are met through the use of video content, structured activities, and clear instructions that do not rely on the teacher's subject knowledge.
            - The cover teacher should not be required to demonstrate or model any concepts. Any activities that involve modelling should be clearly explained through a video or worksheet that students can follow independently.
            - Provide a list of considerations at the end of the end of the lesson plan.

            Based on the information provided, write a lesson plan for the cover lesson, ensuring that it is simple, accessible, and effective for both the teacher and students.
